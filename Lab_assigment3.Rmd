This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
id_num <- 027
set.seed(id_num)
theta = id_num/10
M <- 1000
N <- 10
## sample N rv; then replicate M times and write the results as an N*M matrix
x <- matrix(rexp(N*M, rate=1/theta), nrow = N)
## calculate sample mean in each column
sample_mean <- colMeans(x)
## calculate sample sd of each column; 2 in 'apply' indicates the coordinate to keep as output
sample_sd <- sd(sample_mean)
## check how good the CI are:
for (alpha in c(.01, .05, .1)){
  ##chi-square distribution
  lower <- 2*N*theta / qchisq(1-alpha/2, df=2*N)
  upper <- 2*N*theta / qchisq(alpha/2, df=2*N)
  length <- upper - lower
  cat(alpha, ": ", sum((sample_mean <= upper) & (sample_mean >= lower))/ M, " length ", length, "\n", sep = "")
}

## Student approxumation has the smallest precision. Hovewer, normal approximation is more accurate then the student approximation. In this case normal approximation is the best one.

##Conﬁdence intervals contain the parameter θ with prescribed probability. As in previous task, Normal approximation is better

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
